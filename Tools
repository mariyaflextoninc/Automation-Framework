Tools used to build the application:
------------------------------------

Browsers:  
The application should work in different browsers as expected. We can automate testcases using Internet Explorer,FireFox,
Chrome and Safari Here in my project I used FireFox.

Selenium WebDriver: 
In this automation process, the selenium webdriver makes direct calls with the browser using each browsers's 
native support for automation. It drives the browser. 

Java: 
Java is a flexible language to write tests.

JUnit:
It is a usint testing framework for java programing language.It has sveral APIs to run test.
In my project I have incorporated selenium with JUnit.Or I rather suggest you to use TestNG Framework, 
as it is much powerful than JUnit and it gives the beautiful HTML reports, which we actually need in Selenium.

Eclipse:
You can use Eclipse or InteliJ IDE for creating our selenium project. This project is created using eclipse IDE.
Eclipse is a collection of tools for development and testing. 

Maven: 
It is a build automation tool.It makes build consistent with other projects.Since we are using java, maven is the appropriate one.
Maven is also used to manage the dependencies. For example if you are using selenium version 2.35 and any later point of time you 
have to use some other version, then same can be managed easily by Maven.

Apache SureFire:
For generating the test report you can use Apache SureFire. I will describe how to use it in our project later..
